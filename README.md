# PublicBudgetOntology-basedIntegration
Public Budget data integration through ontology
An experiment on how to offer integrated information that may needed during cycle of public budgeting.
Some aims to mention are:
- represent a correct fragment of knowledge domain regarding public budgeting through an ontology
- identify sources such the ones published on the Ministry of Finance, open data Albania, institute of statistics
- write Turtle syntax GAV mappings in Ontop reasoner
- identify typical queries over the ontology and offer them as ready-made ones through an editor-like application in Java using an SPARQL endpoint
- enable the user to edit or write his/her own queries in SPARQL over the ontology elements
- attempts to experiment data provenance for user, semi-autonomous mapping and knowledge update, inconsistency tolerance
